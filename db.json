      "description": "The first signature shoe to really set things off was the Air Jordan I. It wasn't known at the time, but Peter Moore's design in 1984 would radically shift the narrative of sneaker culture.  The Air Jordan I was unlike anything we'd ever seen before in terms of colors. The strictly black-and-red combination was actually banned by the front offices of the NBA. That decision to ban the shoe created this James Dean, outlaw-type aura around the Air Jordan I. There have been 28 other Air Jordan models released since that first shoe. Still, the Jordan I has been released in countless colorways and modifications. It really has stood the test of time. Despite not being a technically savvy product like some of the other kicks on this list, the significance of the Air Jordan I makes it the top signature shoe ever made.",

But true Jordan fans covet the Space Jam editions more than the rest.Worn by Jordan during the film Space Jam, the black midsole and leather toe were brought to life by the white underlay and a blue Jumpman logo.To show how popular the model remains, in December 2014, Jordan Brand released the 'Legend Blue‘ edition of the shoes.That particular version resulted in $80 million in sales, per SportScanInfo (via Matthew Kisch of the Portland Business Journal). The Air Jordan XI is a true staple of not only basketball culture but also pop culture.",

Revisiting the history of the sneaker, Sole Collector's Steve Jaconetta also raised a good point: The Air Jordan III not only marked Hatfield's debut, but it also was the first shoe to feature the Jumpman logo.To sum things up: Without these shoes, the Air Jordan line would look a lot different than it does today.",

To this day, new color patterns and designs continue to cover the iconic mold.The Foamposite was an outlandish design for the times. The grooves wedged into the sidewalls of the midsole were different than anything Nike had released prior. But where the Foams really thrived was from a technological aspect.These kicks were sturdy yet forgiving and were packed with a serious cushioning system.Credit goes to Nike's current creative director and vice president of innovation, Eric Avar. Avar was the father of the Foamposite revolution, per News.Nike.com.In the press release detailing the history of the kicks, a forgotten piece of information was revealed: 'While many attribute the Foamposite to Penny Hardaway (Air Penny III), University of Arizona freshman Mike Bibby was the one to debut the shoe during the 1997 tournament.'On par with some of the greatest releases in sneaker history, the Nike Air Foamposite One remains a pillar of greatness.",

Whether we're discussing the shoes in high-top or low-top form, the support and lightweight materials that encompass these shoes are primo.Like the rest of Nike's signature kicks nowadays, a lack of original colorways was never an issue.

With that boost in technology accompanying the product, the Jordan XII not only looked amazing, but playing in the shoes was a joy as well.The XII featured plenty of support, and it was surprisingly light and ridiculously durable. Because of its elite style, you could argue that the Jordan XII was actually a better-looking shoe than its predecessor.Jordan aficionados will argue either side of the coin, but that's what we love about shoes. There is no right answer.Even if you have the Jordan XII ranked slightly below the XIs, you can not deny how amazing this was. I mean come on, Jordan himself wore these during the ' Flu Game' and those shoes wound up being auctioned off for $104,765 in 2013, as reported by ESPN's Darren Rovell.",

James became that guy.All of James' models were special, but one shoe that made tidal waves was the Zoom LeBron II.Nike was put in a tough place considering James' first shoe was such a big deal. Instead of treading water, the company went full speed ahead and produced the Zoom LeBron II. Dressed up with a strap for additional support, these kicks didn't need a ton of colors and vibrant patterns to make an impact. They were simply clean, bulky—in a good way—and hyper-focused. Due to the fact that King James is such a popular player, his recent line of sneakers has absolutely flooded the market. While you can easily get your hands on a pair of LeBron 12s or even 11s, finding the Zoom LeBron II for a decent price won't be easy. For more details on this shoe, the good people at Nice Kicks analyzed one particular version of the Zoom Lebron II in the video above.",

The materials used made for an industrial-strength sneaker that looked and felt great.To add salt to the wounds of other signature kicks, the Air Jordan IV also has great meaning behind it.

There's something distinct about the one-piece upper that makes these shoes work in harmonious perfection. Performance is crucial to judging these types of shoes. As far as that department goes, the XX9 doesn't disappoint. The ability to breathe in these sneakers while still enjoying a NASA-type level of functionality is what makes the XX9 a distinguished breadwinner.

Nike deserves a lot of credit for finding a way to walk the line between giving people a rigid shoe in the protection department while not sacrificing an ounce of flexibility.Bryant has continued to mix his love for low-top models in with the highs.

So, what better time is there than now to let you know why these sneakers are ranked so high on this list? First off, forget about what Jordan did for the Wizards. Politicking strictly about the sneakers, the XVII's were ridiculous. When you slipped your foot into one of the kicks, it felt like you had a supportive nylon brace wrapped around your ankle. Embracing all of your hardwood needs every step of the way, the white base with a black lace overlay was the perfect formula to go out and stunt on people. If you didn't own a pair of these kicks, you may forget that they came packed in a metal briefcase. Maybe the good people at Jordan Brand decided that when you have a nuclear, eye-popping blue material crawling up from the soles, you needed a serious case to go along with it.

Arriving to reboot the Chicago Bulls franchise in 2008, D-Rose signed a deal with Adidas after the draft that cemented his sneaker future. There have been a lot of great signature shoes produced for Rose, but his very first one—the adiZero Rose 1—is still the pinnacle of the line. Infused with an open ankle strap, the adiZero Rose 1 conformed to give consumers a solid amount of support. Besides the technical aspects, these were also really good-looking shoes—the traditional black colorway especially. These kicks remind you of an updated version of the Air Jordan XX. From the ankle strap to the leather layover toward the front of the shoe, the adiZero Rose 1 was a colossal achievement for the Adidas brand.",

      "description": "We've seen a few basketball shoes already—as expected—but don't forget about all of the trainers Nike released during the '90s. Focusing in on one of the most popular athletes of that decade, Nike handed Ken Griffey Jr. his very own shoe during his first run with the Seattle Mariners. Griffey had a few signature offerings, but the most recognizable one was the Nike Air Griffey Max 1. Marked as an athletic trainer, the Griffey Max 1 was another quintessential '90s sneaker.  The air bubbles lining the sole and No. 24 strap toward the ankle were staples of the shoe's framework.  Discussing the history of the sneakers, Riley Jones of Complex.com formulated the following piece of information: 'In 1996, Griffey finally got his first true signature model. The Kid himself requested a bold, unique design. He also wanted a turf version of the model to pair with his cleats so that he could rotate between the two for games, workouts, and practice.' Nike released a ton of dope trainers around the same time Griffey Jr. got his. But they weren't the Nike Air Griffey Max 1. As the video posted above from Nice Kicks shows, these shoes are still getting love.",

      "description": "You may not have heard about BrandBlack just yet, but don't worry—that will change. Dubbed as the new kid on the block, this sneaker company brought Los Angeles Clippers guard Jamal Crawford in as its first signature athlete. Giving Crawford his own pair of shoes, BrandBlack created the J-Crossover collection. The first edition felt like it came out of left field and shook up the industry. It was super sleek, and the elements used in the kicks were reminiscent of some of the greatest sneakers we've seen over the years. With that first shoe behind it, BrandBlack fired up the engines and produced the J. Crossover II, taking the silhouette to another level. In just about a year's time, the J. Crossover model has become a factor. The shoes perform well, have a suave feel to them and are super comfortable—thanks to the excellent cushioning platform that was installed. For sneakerheads looking toward the future, the J. Crossover II is a shoe that definitely has earned a spot on this countdown.  ",

      "description": "Prior to Dikembe Mutombo blocking cereal boxes in Geico commercials, the 7foot 2 center was a defensive carnivore who used his trademark finger wag to ruin the hopes and dreams of anyone daring enough to come into the paint. Adidas gave the big man his very own shoe to pay homage to his personality and defensive aura. The Adidas Mutombo is a '90s hallmark. Built as a high-top, the center's No. 55 was thrust onto the ankle support piece as well as the tongue. Since the shoes were first released, various colorways have resurfaced on the market. It's not only a testament to how popular these sneakers have been, but it's also a testament to how the structure of the shoe has stood the test of time.",
